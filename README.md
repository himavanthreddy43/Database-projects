# 🔍 Research Projects Database – My First ER & SQL Project!

📍 *NIAT Hyderabad* | 🎓 1st Year Student

As part of my learning journey in database systems, I designed and implemented a *Research Projects Database* to efficiently manage data related to projects, employees, and funding agencies.

This involved designing a complete *Entity-Relationship (ER) schema* and writing *SQL statements* to create and populate tables with real-world relationships like project assignments, managers, and funding links.
